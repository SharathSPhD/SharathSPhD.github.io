Wondering what this crazy analogy between a Large Language Model (LLM) and a celestial body is all about? Rest assured, this is not an imaginary rant (or perhaps the vociferous LLM proponents would argue it to be a chain-of-thought logical reasoning?) from a chatbot. Let's take a step back and piece things together, drawing from my experience straddling multiple professional worlds from aerospace engineering to data science over the last two decades.

There would hardly be any child who would not be bemused or played with a spinning top. Add a dash of colours to the top and it transforms into a spinning rainbow. A top which is perhaps as old as humanity in some sense is a seed to what we call today as gyroscope which has revolutionised space travel and consumer goods (mobile phones) alike. And that is where the hike to Saturn's moon becomes possible.
